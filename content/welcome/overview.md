This page is an overview of Traxitt.

## What is Traxitt? ##

[whatistraxitt](../_fragments/whatistraxitt.md ':include')

Traxitt takes a developer and user centric view to cluster computing while mainting DevOps control over the aspects that they :heart: and are accustomed to. We would never want to piss off DevOps!

We have taken care to reuse what is already available so you can leverage your investment in these excellent technologies.

## Our Core Values ##

Some core values

* Leverage existing open source technologies
* Developer centric without sacrificing DevOps
* Resist lock in wherever possible
* Work nicely with just-a-bunch-of-machines (JBOM) or AWS, Azure and GKE

## What is a Cluster Operating System? ##

Operating system abstract away low level aspects of the underlying computing hardware and key software resources. Over time, Operating Systems have gone from handling single CPU computers, to multi-core processors and now, any number of CPU and GPU combinations.

At Traxitt, we asked ourselves what this means in the age of Cloud Computing. These days, engineers who work on web, IoT and various other SOA style projects have to work with not one, but a cluster of computers. This is were Cloud Computing architectures have now moved towards microservices and service meshes.

There is a good deal of technology already developed to help manage clusters of computers. Technologies such as [kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) and [Docker](http://docker.com) have made it much easier to have to manage and orchestrate a cluster of machines.

* Steep learning curve
* Development vs Production
* Very DevOps centric
